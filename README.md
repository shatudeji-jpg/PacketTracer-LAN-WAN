Basic Network Topology – LAN & WAN (Packet Tracer)
This project represents a basic network simulation I created using Cisco Packet Tracer to apply my understanding of LANs, WANs, and the functions of various network devices, based on what I’ve learned so far in Module 1: Introduction to Networking.

What This Project Covers:
- Understanding the difference between LAN and WAN
- Identifying and placing end devices and intermediary devices
- Recognizing the function of each device
- Connecting two LANs using a point-to-point serial DCE/DTE connection (WAN link)
- No IP addressing or pinging yet — that will come in later modules.
  
Topology Overview
- 2 LANs (each with: PCs, switches)
- 1 WAN link between LANs (using 2 routers + serial cable)
- Devices are placed but not yet configured

 Device Functions
End Devices:
- PCs: Send/receive user data.
Intermediary Devices:
- Switches: Connect devices within a LAN
- Routers: Connect different networks (LANs/WAN)
Media:
- Ethernet Cables: Wired LAN connections
- Serial DCE/DTE Cable: WAN connection between routers
  - DCE side sets clock speed
  - DTE side follows the speed
    
Key Concepts Learned
- LAN: Local connection within a building
- WAN: Long-distance connection between LANs
- DCE/DTE Serial Connection: Controls data timing across WAN.
